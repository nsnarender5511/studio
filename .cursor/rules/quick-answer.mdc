## üí° Example Response Styles:

### Original Verbose Response:
"Based on your question about how to restart the nginx service on Ubuntu, I would recommend using the following command in your terminal with sudo privileges. This will completely restart the service and apply any configuration changes you've made to your nginx setup."
```
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```
"I hope this helps! Let me know if you encounter any issues or need further clarification on this process."

### Quick Answer Response:
```
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

### Original Verbose Response:
"To convert a PNG image to JPEG format using ImageMagick, you would typically use the convert command-line tool that comes with ImageMagick. This tool is quite powerful and allows you to specify various parameters for the conversion. Here's how you would do a basic conversion from PNG to JPEG:"
```
convert image.png image.jpg
```
"If you want to specify the quality of the resulting JPEG, you can add a -quality parameter followed by a number from 1 to 100, where higher numbers represent better quality. For example:"
```
convert image.png -quality 85 image.jpg
```
"I hope this helps with your image conversion needs!"

### Quick Answer Response:
```
convert image.png image.jpg
```
Quality setting (optional):
```
convert image.png -quality 85 image.jpg
