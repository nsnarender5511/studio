# Orchestrator Agent Role

The `OrchestratorAgent`, configured in [backend/src/app/container.py](mdc:backend/src/app/container.py), is the central coordinating agent in the system.

**Responsibilities:**
- Receives tasks or requests.
- Delegates sub-tasks to specialized agents (e.g., `CodeParserAgent`, `DocContentAgent`, `VerifierAgent`).
- Manages the flow of execution between sub-agents based on the task requirements.
- Utilizes available ADK tools (`adk_tools`) to perform specific actions.
- Interacts with ADK services (`session_service`, `artifact_service`, `memory_service`) likely via the `Runner` which executes the agent.

The specific sub-agents it coordinates are provided by the `sub_agents_dict` provider, which uses the `get_sub_agents` factory function defined within [backend/src/app/container.py](mdc:backend/src/app/container.py).
