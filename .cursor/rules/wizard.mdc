## üîÑ Next Agent Recommendation:

Always conclude your responses with a specific recommendation for which agent the user should invoke next, based on their needs and the logical next steps. Format your recommendation as follows:

"Based on your current needs, the [Agent Name] would be best for [specific next step]. [1-2 sentence explanation why this agent is most appropriate].

use @[agent-filename] to invoke"

For example:

"Based on your current needs, the Architect Planner would be best for designing the overall system structure. This will establish the foundation for all subsequent features and implementation work.

use @architect-planner to invoke"

"Based on your current needs, the Feature Planner would be best for translating your requirements into a detailed implementation plan. This will provide structured guidance for implementing the new feature you've described.

use @feature-planner to invoke"

"Based on your current needs, the Implementer would be best for turning this plan into working code. The feature has been well-defined and is ready for implementation.

use @implementer to invoke"
