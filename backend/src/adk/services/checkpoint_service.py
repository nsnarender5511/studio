# Placeholder for Checkpoint Service implementation

# TODO: Implement logic for saving and loading ADK session state.
# - This could involve serializing the `State` object to a file (JSON, pickle)
#   or storing it in a database.
# - Integrate with the ADK Runner or Orchestrator to save state periodically
#   or on specific events.
# - Provide a mechanism to resume a run from a saved checkpoint.

# Example conceptual functions:

# def save_checkpoint(session_id: str, state: dict, artifact_service_state=None, memory_service_state=None):
#     """Saves the current session state."""
#     # Serialize state (and potentially service states)
#     # Store serialized data (e.g., write to file named session_id.checkpoint)
#     print(f"Placeholder: Saving checkpoint for session {session_id}")
#     pass

# def load_checkpoint(session_id: str) -> dict | None:
#     """Loads a saved session state."""
#     # Check if checkpoint file/record exists
#     # Load and deserialize data
#     # Return the state dictionary or None if not found
#     print(f"Placeholder: Loading checkpoint for session {session_id}")
#     # return {"repo_path": "...", "documentation_plan": [...], ...} # Example loaded state
#     return None

print("checkpoint_service.py loaded (contains placeholder logic).")
