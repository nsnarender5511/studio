# Placeholder for Memory Manager Agent
# This agent would interact with the Memory Tools and Memory Service
# to manage working memory, long-term storage, and semantic search.

# Example structure (to be fully implemented later)
from google.adk.agents import BaseAgent
# from ...tools.memory_tools import memory_interaction_tool
# from ...services.memory_service import memory_service # Requires service setup

class MemoryManagerAgent(BaseAgent):
    def __init__(self, tools=None, memory_service=None):
        super().__init__(name="MemoryManagerAgent")
        self.tools = tools or [] # Expect memory_interaction_tool
        self.memory_service = memory_service # Link to the actual memory service

    async def run(self, state, artifact_service):
        print("MemoryManagerAgent: Placeholder run.")
        # TODO: Implement logic to store relevant info (e.g., successful documentation patterns,
        # summaries) into memory using tools/service.
        # TODO: Implement logic to retrieve relevant context from memory to aid
        # other agents (e.g., provide context for content generation).
        return state # Return unchanged state for now

# Instantiation would typically happen in main.py where services are available
# memory_manager_agent = MemoryManagerAgent(tools=[memory_interaction_tool], memory_service=...)
